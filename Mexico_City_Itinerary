Mexico City - 4 Day Itinerary

Currency Exchange – How Much Pesos to Carry?
    Recommended Cash in Pesos: MXN 3,500 – 5,000 (~$200-$300 USD)
    Why?
    Most places accept credit cards, but street food, taxis, markets, and some small restaurants prefer cash.
    You can withdraw pesos from ATMs in Mexico for better exchange rates than currency exchange counters.
    If you plan on shopping in local markets, having small bills (MXN 50s, 100s) is useful.
